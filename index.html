            I was born in Decatur, GA. Yes, I'm one of the few Atlanta natives. I enjoy all kinds of things, but you want to know what I can't stand?
            I can't stand writing about myself. Maybe one day, I'll actually enjoy telling people about myself. I doubt that day is
            today, though. It's extremely difficult for me to wite anything.
            Actually, I think I would rather go through actual boot camp than spend 5 or 10 minutes writing about myself.
            I'm really that bad at it. Can you tell? I mean, I've only spent all of this time wrtitng about how bad I am
            at writing. It must be sinking in by now.

            Oh yeah, I love Formula 1. I could talk about Formula 1 forever. Ask me any question about the modern era of
            Formula 1 and I can come up with a well thought out answer.  I actually plan on building my own website for a Formula 1 podcast one day.
            That would be my dream.  Being able to talk about Formula 1 whenever I want.
